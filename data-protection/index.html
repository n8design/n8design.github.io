<h2 id="google-analytics">Google Analytics</h2>
<p>We want to improve our offer therefor this web page uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (‘Google’) on the legal basis of the­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­ ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­predominant able interest (analysis of website use).</p>
<p>When using our website a connection is made via software to the servers of Google and data is transferred to Google servers, some of which are in the USA. Google Anaytics also uses cookies to store information about the website user and for analysis of use of the website by the website user.</p>
<p>This website uses the function ‚Activation of IP-anonymisation’. Your IP-address is abbreviated beforehand by Google within the member states of the EU or in other contract states of the agreement about the European Economic Area. The full IP-address is only transferred to a Google server and abbreviated there in exceptional cases.</p>
<p>According to Google, Google will use the compiled data to evaluate the use of the website, to compile reports about website activities and to provide services related to website use and internet use..</p>
<p>Google may also transfer this information to third parties insofar as this is prescribed by law or insofar as third parties process this data for Google. Detailed information about what Google Analytics do with user data is to be found in the data protection declaration of Google or of Google Analytics.</p>
<p>We also use the technical extension &ldquo;Google Signals&rdquo;, which enables cross-device tracking. This makes it possible to assign an individual website visitor to different end devices. However, this only happens if the visitor has logged in to a Google service when visiting a website and has activated the option &ldquo;personalized advertising&rdquo; in his Google account settings at the same time. Even then, however, no personal data or user profiles are accessible to us; they remain anonymous to us.</p>
<p>If you do not want &ldquo;Google Signals&rdquo; to be used, you can disable the &ldquo;Personalized advertising&rdquo; option in your Google Account preferences.</p>
<h2 id="deactivating-google-analytics">Deactivating Google Analytics</h2>
<p>You can prevent capture of your user data by Google Analytics generally for all websites by downloading and installing the Browser-Plugin here:  <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de</a></p>
<p>You can prevent the capture of your user data by Google Analytics only on this website by clicking the following link. An opt-out cookie is set which prevents the capture of your data when visiting this website in future.</p>
